## Enhancement Plan
1.	**Software Design and Engineering** – Here I planned to walk through the overall design of the AnimalShelter class, highlighting strengths such as clear structure, but also pointing out weaknesses such as outdated method calls, lack of documentation, and poor error handling. My outline ensured I explained what the code currently does, why certain issues matter, and what enhancements I plan to make.
2.	**Algorithms and Data Structures** – In this section, I focused on how filters and queries are built in the dashboard. My outline included noting inefficiencies like applying filters in Python after fetching data, reliance on raw strings for breed names, and the absence of pagination. I made sure to describe both the current logic and the improvements I plan, such as centralized query builders, using constants or enums, and leveraging MongoDB aggregation pipelines.
3.	**Databases** – For the database review, my outline guided me to show how the AnimalShelter class connects to MongoDB and interacts with the animals collection. I discussed the strengths of direct CRUD operations but emphasized weaknesses such as lack of projections, missing index usage, and hard-coded credentials. My script included specific enhancement plans like adding projections, ensuring indices on frequent queries, and adding connection timeouts and error handling.

## Enhancement Journal
<details>
<summary>Enhancement 1 - Software Design and Engineering</summary>
  The artifact I selected is a Python Dash dashboard that connects to my MongoDB CRUD module (the AnimalShelter class). It was originally created in a previous course to fulfill client requirements for Grazioso Salvare, where I built a database interface and visual dashboard for the Austin Animal Center dataset. The initial version provided a simple layout with filters, a data table, and basic queries. In the Capstone, I took this existing work and refactored it into a modular Dash application with a cleaner structure, including separate layout, callbacks, and service layers.

  I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design and implement a full-stack solution that integrates a database back end with a user-facing web interface. The dashboard highlights multiple skills: database operations via CRUD in MongoDB, query optimization using projection and pagination, and front-end design using Dash components. The enhancements also showcase my knowledge of secure coding practices, since I replaced hardcoded connection details with environment variables and added query whitelisting. Together, these improvements demonstrate both technical depth and professional readiness.
  
  In this enhancement, I demonstrated my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions with appropriate trade-offs by implementing server-side pagination and modularizing the application. I also met the outcome of applying innovative tools and techniques, using Dash testing and structured service layers, and showing a security mindset by incorporating least-privilege MongoDB connections and safer query handling. At this point, I do not need to update my outcome-coverage plans because the enhancements successfully align with the goals I outlined.
  
  The process of enhancing and modifying this artifact taught me how important modular architecture is for readability and maintainability. I learned to separate concerns more effectively, making the code easier to debug and extend. One of the biggest challenges I faced was environment setup: conflicting bson packages, relative import issues, and Dash version changes caused multiple errors. By systematically troubleshooting and restructuring the project, I improved both my technical skills and my resilience in solving problems. Overall, this enhancement gave me practical experience with building a production-ready dashboard and strengthened my confidence in handling end-to-end software development.

  <summary>Enhancement 2 - Algorithms and Data Structures</summary>
  The artifact I worked on for this enhancement is the service layer of my Python Dash dashboard, which interfaces with MongoDB through my CRUD module. This component was originally created in an earlier course to support queries for the Austin Animal Center dataset and display results in the dashboard’s table and metrics. The original version was functional but limited: it used basic find queries without optimizations and recalculated aggregations each time. In the Capstone, I revisited this artifact to strengthen its efficiency, scalability, and algorithmic rigor.
  
  I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it highlights my ability to apply algorithms and data structures in a practical way to improve application performance. The enhancements demonstrate key skills: implementing keyset pagination for efficient query traversal, designing compound indexes aligned with frequent filters, and building caching mechanisms for repeated aggregations like top breeds and age histograms. These improvements show how I can go beyond simply making an application work to making it robust, scalable, and performant. The refactoring also showcases my ability to think critically about trade-offs in algorithmic design.

  I specifically wanted to demonstrate algorithmic thinking and efficiency improvements, and I achieved that through caching strategies, index creation, and normalized signatures for cache keys. These directly map to the outcome of designing and evaluating computing solutions with algorithmic principles and trade-offs. At this point, I do not need to revise my outcome-coverage plans, because this enhancement clearly addresses the goals I had set for the algorithms and data structures component of the Capstone.

  Through the process of enhancing and modifying this artifact, I learned how much impact indexing and caching can have on performance, particularly in data-heavy applications. I also deepened my understanding of keyset pagination and why it scales better than offset-based approaches. One of the main challenges I faced was dealing with conflicting Python packages and ensuring that the correct versions of PyMongo and its bson library were installed, which required methodical debugging. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of not just solving problems but solving them efficiently and with attention to maintainability.

  <summary>Enhancement 3 - Databases</summary>
  The artifact I selected for Category Three is my Python-based MongoDB CRUD module, which serves as the database interface for my Dash dashboard. This component was originally created in an earlier course as part of the Grazioso Salvare project to handle create, read, update, and delete operations for the Austin Animal Center dataset. At that time, it used simple database methods without structured responses or strong validation. For the Capstone project, I revisited this module to make it secure, maintainable, and production-ready, ensuring it could integrate seamlessly with the Dash front end and support caching from my algorithmic enhancements.
  
  I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates a solid understanding of database design, data access patterns, and software engineering best practices. The updated module showcases my ability to modernize code using the latest PyMongo methods, implement pagination and projections for efficiency, and secure configuration through environment variables. I also added structured JSON-style responses to improve readability and debugging, as well as validation to ensure safe data handling. These improvements highlight my ability to work on real-world data systems where performance, security, and consistency are equally important.

  The work clearly demonstrates my ability to use innovative tools and techniques in computing practices, and to develop a security mindset that anticipates potential vulnerabilities. I also showed an understanding of trade-offs in database operations, balancing efficiency with reliability. Since the enhancement achieved all of the targeted course outcomes, there are no further updates to my outcome-coverage plans for this category.
  
  While enhancing and modifying this artifact, I learned the value of designing database interfaces that are both secure and adaptable. Implementing environment-based configuration taught me how to protect sensitive connection details and prepare code for deployment in multiple environments. One challenge I faced was ensuring compatibility between PyMongo versions and handling bson import conflicts, which required careful dependency management. Overcoming those issues reinforced the importance of environment isolation and version control. Overall, this experience deepened my understanding of secure, maintainable database engineering—an essential skill for my career in data engineering and backend improvement.

# CS499-ePortfolio

## Self-Assessment

Throughout my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have developed a strong foundation in software design, programming, data management, and system architecture. The process of completing my coursework and assembling my ePortfolio has given me the opportunity to reflect on my growth as a developer, problem-solver, and collaborator. By refining multiple artifacts—from software engineering projects to database and algorithm enhancements—I have demonstrated my ability to design and implement practical computing solutions while aligning them with professional and ethical standards. This ePortfolio highlights not only my technical competencies but also my commitment to lifelong learning and professional excellence in the field of computer science.

My academic journey has strengthened my ability to collaborate effectively in diverse, team-oriented environments. Many projects required working with peers on shared codebases, where clear communication, version control, and task delegation were essential. I also gained valuable experience in communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders through design documentation, software design documents (SDDs), and system architecture diagrams. These experiences taught me how to bridge the gap between business needs and technical implementation, ensuring that solutions deliver value and are understandable to varied audiences.

Core computer science concepts—such as data structures, algorithms, software engineering, and database design—have been central to my development as a professional. I applied algorithmic principles in optimizing data retrieval and processing tasks, improving the performance and scalability of applications. In software engineering, I strengthened my ability to follow structured development lifecycles using Agile methodologies, while employing best practices such as modular design, unit testing, and version control. My experience with database systems, particularly through CRUD operations and data visualization dashboards, improved my understanding of relational and non-relational data models. Additionally, I developed a security mindset by incorporating authentication, secure data handling, and system validation to mitigate vulnerabilities and protect user information.

The artifacts in my ePortfolio collectively represent my comprehensive skill set across the computer science discipline. The Software Engineering and Design artifact demonstrates my ability to structure complex systems and create maintainable, scalable applications. The Algorithms and Data Structures artifact showcases my capacity to design efficient computational solutions that improve application performance. The Databases artifact highlights my ability to develop secure, data-driven applications that integrate backend and frontend systems effectively. Together, these artifacts demonstrate my technical range, from architecture and implementation to testing and optimization.

Developing my ePortfolio has helped me identify my professional strengths and refine my career goals. I aspire to contribute to innovative software development projects that emphasize efficiency, usability, and data-driven design. The capstone experience, in particular, has reinforced my confidence in delivering end-to-end solutions—from conceptualization to deployment—and has prepared me to excel in dynamic, technology-driven environments. Ultimately, this portfolio represents not just my technical abilities, but my dedication to continuous improvement, collaboration, and ethical practice in the field of computer science.

## Enhancement Proposal
1.	Software Design and Engineering – Here I planned to walk through the overall design of the AnimalShelter class, highlighting strengths such as clear structure, but also pointing out weaknesses such as outdated method calls, lack of documentation, and poor error handling. My outline ensured I explained what the code currently does, why certain issues matter, and what enhancements I plan to make.
2.	Algorithms and Data Structures – In this section, I focused on how filters and queries are built in the dashboard. My outline included noting inefficiencies like applying filters in Python after fetching data, reliance on raw strings for breed names, and the absence of pagination. I made sure to describe both the current logic and the improvements I plan, such as centralized query builders, using constants or enums, and leveraging MongoDB aggregation pipelines.
3.	Databases – For the database review, my outline guided me to show how the AnimalShelter class connects to MongoDB and interacts with the animals collection. I discussed the strengths of direct CRUD operations but emphasized weaknesses such as lack of projections, missing index usage, and hard-coded credentials. My script included specific enhancement plans like adding projections, ensuring indices on frequent queries, and adding connection timeouts and error handling.

## Enhancement Journal
### Enhancement 1
  The artifact I selected is a Python Dash dashboard that connects to my MongoDB CRUD module (the AnimalShelter class). It was originally created in a previous course to fulfill client requirements for Grazioso Salvare, where I built a database interface and visual dashboard for the Austin Animal Center dataset. The initial version provided a simple layout with filters, a data table, and basic queries. In the Capstone, I took this existing work and refactored it into a modular Dash application with a cleaner structure, including separate layout, callbacks, and service layers.

  I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design and implement a full-stack solution that integrates a database back end with a user-facing web interface. The dashboard highlights multiple skills: database operations via CRUD in MongoDB, query optimization using projection and pagination, and front-end design using Dash components. The enhancements also showcase my knowledge of secure coding practices, since I replaced hardcoded connection details with environment variables and added query whitelisting. Together, these improvements demonstrate both technical depth and professional readiness.
  
  I met the course outcomes I set in Module One for this enhancement. Specifically, I demonstrated my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions with appropriate trade-offs by implementing server-side pagination and modularizing the application. I also met the outcome of applying innovative tools and techniques, using Dash testing and structured service layers, and showing a security mindset by incorporating least-privilege MongoDB connections and safer query handling. At this point, I do not need to update my outcome-coverage plans because the enhancements successfully align with the goals I outlined.
  
  The process of enhancing and modifying this artifact taught me how important modular architecture is for readability and maintainability. I learned to separate concerns more effectively, making the code easier to debug and extend. One of the biggest challenges I faced was environment setup: conflicting bson packages, relative import issues, and Dash version changes caused multiple errors. By systematically troubleshooting and restructuring the project, I improved both my technical skills and my resilience in solving problems. Overall, this enhancement gave me practical experience with building a production-ready dashboard and strengthened my confidence in handling end-to-end software development.
